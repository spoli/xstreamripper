KNOWN BUGS
==========

Colour of table entry clashes, when selected, cannot tell that it has been selected and should be edited.

The Short Version String is currently "StreamRipperX 1.03". This is too long to fit the Version column in the Finder's List View, in Apple System Profiler or other apps listing app versions. So it should be just "1.03", following the sample of all apps Apple ships with Mac OS X. The Get Info String appears in the Finder's Get Info window behind "Version:". So it should begin with the version number as well. Instead of "StreamRipperX - Internet radio to MP3" just put "1.03 - Internet radio to MP3" there. The app name is already visible in Get Info. 

StreamRipperX sometimes places a trailing space at the end of an artist's name in an ID3 tag. This can result in two entries from the same artist in iTunes. Can we have an option to have SRX remove the trailing space, even if the space comes from the streamed content?

BUG - umlaut character not displayed in table correctly when parsing C string from sr lib.
 test with radiocubik:		http://streamstation.radiocubik.com:8000
 test with japan-a-radio:	http://xstream1.com:8042/    http://64.21.4.182:8002

(DONE) Menu item "Rip Stream" should be ghosted over when ripping.
(DONE) Menu item "Stop ripping" should be added

(FIXED) Build/Compile problems - absolute directory path / name problems?

- 'localhost' resolution problem
User's network setup: static ip, dns, wins, internet-connection through a gateway with firewall installed.
Localhost & 127.0.0.1 failed, but static ip was fine.

(FIXED) Foreign characters are sometimes a problem in the filename - and causes ripping to stop.
'yuml' character caused probs.  replaced by 'y'

(FIXED) Drag'n'drop of .pls link doesn't always work.  HTTP 302 redirect handled by curl.

- MP2 streams don't play and generate an error
http://music.uar.net/top/den_narodzhennia.mp2
"SR_ERROR_NOT_SHOUTCAST_STREAM"

- (DONE) Duplicate song entries - no more...

- (DONE) - 7Aug02
When invoking ripStop: the ProgressBar sometimes still animates, when it should be stopped
and the Status: field still shows a state e.g. Buffering.

(DONE) - 8 Aug 02
- "Quit Application" (invokes NSApplication terminate:) kills the application without first checking
  if we want to quit



OTHER STUFF / NOTES

NSBundle mainBundle infoDictionary
{contents = "CFBundleVersion"} = <CFString 0x157b90 [0x8016024c]>{contents = "0.1"}
(v0.11) save the version in defaults as CFBundleVersion
